## Scripts Completion Acknowledgement

Both scripts for retrieving user data from LinkedIn have been successfully completed and are ready for review.

### Scripts:

1. **WebScrape_Browser_Automation:** This script utilizes browser automation techniques using Selenium to scrape LinkedIn search results and retrieve user data.

2. **Webscrape_API:** This script makes use of LinkedIn's API to fetch user data based on the provided first and last names.

Both scripts are functional, organized, and adhere to coding standards. They handle errors, include logging, contain clear comments, and use meaningful variable names.

### GitHub Repository:

I have created a public repository on GitHub to track the progress of the assignment. You can access the repository via the following link:

Please feel free to review the scripts and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
